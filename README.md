## Description:

Sound Minds is a simple, easy-to-use web application which allows users to find new music and share their opinions on it.
Users are able to easily navigate the application and features in a couple ways. When a user wants to find a song to see what others are saying about it, they can easily search for it. Click on a search result and view details about the song, add it to your favorites, listen to a preview and share your opinion.
